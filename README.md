### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jerome, I'm a developer and a musician. 

You'll find here the home of **[JJazzLab-X](https://github.com/jjazzboss/JJazzLab-X)**, a free musical framework :musical_note: used by thousands of musicians to practice their instrument with a virtual band.

---

 ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help to add new capabilities to JJazzLab-X, possibly using AI techniques:
 - Automatically generate slight variations from an existing drums & bass rhythm (e.g. make it more simple or more intense)
 - Generate a realistic and non-boring swing walking bass from a chord lead sheet
 - Humanize drums and bass midi tracks
 
ðŸ“« Get in touch via the contact page of www.jjazzlab.com (the main JJazzLab-X distribution).

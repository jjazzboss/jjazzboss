### Welcome!

You'll find here the home of **[JJazzLab-X](https://github.com/jjazzboss/JJazzLab-X)**, a free musical framework used by thousands of musicians all over the world to practice their instrument with a virtual band.

 ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help to add new backing track generation capabilities:
 - Generate slight variations of an existing drums & bass rhythm (e.g. make it more simple or more intense)
 - Generate a realistic and non-boring jazz walking bass from a chord lead sheet
 - Effectively "humanize" drums and bass midi tracks
 - and more...
 
Don't hesitate to send links to related research papers.
